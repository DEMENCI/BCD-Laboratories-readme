## Databases Laboratory Work Nr.5


### Prerequisites:
  - Microsoft SQL Server 2012
  - Oracle 11g/12c

### Objectives:
  - T-SQL and Oracle data types and build-in functions
  - SQL Server Data Types and Functions
  - Query and Subquery
  - Agregate Functions
  - While, Try-Catch, If-Else
  
  
### Tasks : 

1. Fill in the following code to display the biggest number of the three numbers shown. 

2. Display the first 10 data (Name, Surname of student) in function of Grade value (except 6 and 8) of student on first evaluation at
Database , using IF-ELSE statement. To use variables. 

3. Solve the same task,1, using CASE statement.

4. Modify the exercises from task 1 and 2 for including error processing with TRY-CATCH and RAISERROR.

### Implementation:
**Task 1**  

In this task I have to determine the biggest number from 3 given numbers. I solved this example with IF-ELSE, checking between them with comparison symbols.

 **Conclusion**
 
 During this laboratory work I obtained skills working with Procedural Instructions of T-SQL. Also, I have learned about blocks and variables and how to declare, initialize and operate with variables. Some specific for this laboratory work I have learned about selective structure CASE, alternative structure IF-ELSE, repetitive structure WHILE. How specify and catch the errors.
