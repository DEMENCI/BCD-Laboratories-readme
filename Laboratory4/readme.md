### Conclusion: 
   In this laboratory work I obtained skills operatig with queries(T-SQL language).There are numerous ways of selecting data 
   from database. Even if the tables do not provide the neccesary information we can obtain through different combinations aka 
   joins between tables. There are also functions which can be perfomed on data e.g. counting, average etc.
