In this laboratory work I have made two database with names Student and University.For the first database I have set primary file database grouth to 64 MB till maximum file size 128 MB and for log file I have set grouth to 64 MB till 1024 MB.Also I have added three secondaries files and set the file group name to students_group and also for all files set the grouth to 64 MB till 1024 MB.You can see all these stuff in the images...Next,for the database university I've done all the tasks and the results you can see also in the below pictures.Also,I have made two management's plans for both databases.When I have tried to execute the plans i have got an error that SQL Server Agents is not running,after that I have opened SQL Server Configuration and put the Start Mode to automatic and after that save the changes and click right and i have started the SQL Server Agents and I have solved my problem...
